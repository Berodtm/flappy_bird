- followed above tutorial and adapted code to include mobile phone touch taps and sound effects. 
- MY WORK/DEBUGGING: 
- while developing the tap function for mobile it was really laggy. I had to pre load the images, move the event listeners from the document to the board and finally combine the tap and click event listeners to use pointer down which appeared a lot more efficient.
